## Testing

2. Check browser console for upload logs

   npx prisma studio
   ```

ls -la public/uploads/
```

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backward compatible**

- Old activities with single `imageUrl` still work
- Automatically converted to array format for display
- No data migration needed for existing activities

## Performance Notes
