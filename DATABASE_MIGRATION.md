## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

1. **API Routes**:

   - `/app/api/activities/route.ts` - Now uses Prisma for GET and POST
   - `/app/api/activities/[id]/route.ts` - Now uses Prisma for GET, PUT, DELETE

2. **Pages**:

   - `/app/activities/page.tsx` - Server-side fetching from database with beautiful design
   - `/app/activities/[slug]/page.tsx` - Dynamic page with database integration

3. **Components**:
   - `/components/navigation.tsx` - Added Activities link

### Files Created

1. `/lib/prisma.ts` - Prisma client singleton
2. `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema definition
3. `/prisma/seed.ts` - Seed script to populate database
4. `/prisma/migrations/` - Database migration files
5. `.env` - Environment configuration

### Database Schema

```prisma
model Activity {
  id               String   @id @default(uuid())
  slug             String   @unique
  title            String
  shortDescription String
  longDescription  String
  imageUrl         String
  createdAt        DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## How to Use

### Admin Dashboard

1. Go to `/admin/dashboard`
2. Click "Add New Activity"
3. Fill in the form and upload an image
4. Click "Save Activity"
5. The activity is now saved to the database and will appear on `/activities`

### Viewing Activities

1. Navigate to "Activities" from the main menu
2. Browse all activities in a beautiful card grid
3. Click "Learn More" on any activity to see full details
4. Use the "Back to Activities" button to return to the list

## Database Commands

### View Database

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This opens a visual database browser at http://localhost:5555

### Reset Database

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

This will drop all data and re-run migrations and seed

### Seed Database

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

This will add the sample activities to the database

### Create New Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name description_of_change
```

## Data Migration

Your existing activities from `data/activities.json` have been automatically migrated to the database using the seed script.

## Production Deployment

For production:

1. Consider using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` in your environment variables
3. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` on your production server
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your production domain

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Scalability**: Database can handle thousands of activities
‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: Built-in validation and relationships
‚úÖ **Performance**: Indexed queries and optimized data access
‚úÖ **Real-time**: No need to commit JSON files
‚úÖ **Features**: Easy to add search, filters, pagination
‚úÖ **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with smooth interactions

## Notes

- The old `data/activities.json` file is no longer used but not deleted
- Image uploads still go to `public/uploads/` directory
- Database file is located at `prisma/dev.db` (gitignored)
- All activities are automatically sorted by creation date (newest first)
