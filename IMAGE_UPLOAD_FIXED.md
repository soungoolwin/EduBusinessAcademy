# Image Upload Fixed! âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Next.js Image Configuration**

- Updated `next.config.mjs` to allow images from localhost
- This fixes the issue where Next.js Image component couldn't load local images

### 2. **Image Component Syntax**

- Updated deprecated `layout="fill"` and `objectFit="cover"`
- Changed to modern Next.js 13+ syntax: `fill` prop with `className="object-cover"`
- Fixed in:
  - Admin Dashboard (table view)
  - Admin Dashboard (edit form preview)

### 3. **API Route Improvements**

- Added file size check to ensure files are valid
- Added console logging to track uploads
- Better error handling for image operations

### 4. **What to Do Next**

You need to **restart your dev server** for the Next.js config changes to take effect:

1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Restart it:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How to Test Image Upload

1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/admin/dashboard`
2. Click "Add New Activity"
3. Fill in the form
4. Choose an image file
5. Click "Save Activity"
6. The image should now upload successfully!

## View Your Database Records

### Option 1: Prisma Studio (Easiest - Like TablePlus)

I've already started it for you! Just open:

```
http://localhost:5555
```

You'll see:

- All your activities in a table
- Image URLs (paths to uploaded images)
- Created and updated timestamps
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

### Option 2: TablePlus

1. Open TablePlus
2. Create new SQLite connection
3. Point to: `prisma/dev.db`
4. Connect!

### Option 3: Command Line

```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db
```

Then run:

```sql
SELECT title, imageUrl, createdAt FROM Activity;
```

## Important Notes

### Image Storage

- Images are saved to: `public/uploads/`
- Database stores: Image PATH (e.g., `/uploads/1234567890.jpg`)
- The actual image file is in the filesystem

### Current Image Situation

Your uploads folder is currently empty because:

- Old reference from JSON file doesn't have actual image
- You need to upload new images through the dashboard

### After You Upload an Image

You can verify it's working by:

1. **Check filesystem:**

   ```bash
   ls -la public/uploads/
   ```

   Should show your uploaded images

2. **Check database (Prisma Studio):**

   - Go to `http://localhost:5555`
   - Click "Activity" table
   - See `imageUrl` column with path

3. **View on website:**
   - Go to `/activities`
   - Images should display properly

## Troubleshooting

### Images still not showing?

1. Make sure dev server restarted after config changes
2. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for errors

### Upload not working?

1. Check terminal logs for "Image uploaded successfully"
2. Make sure file is a valid image (jpg, png, etc.)
3. Check file size (keep under 10MB)

### Can't access Prisma Studio?

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Opens at: `http://localhost:5555`
